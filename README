A CScope frontend provides having multiple query results around. It uses windows, so the results won't get away.
For usage see the comments in the script file.

It uses two windows, one for listing the queries done and
another for listing the result of the selected query.
It can be used parallel with the normal cscope frontend of
vim because they use different settings and key bindings.
